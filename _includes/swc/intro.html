<p>
  This hands-on lesson is part of the <em>Introduction to Data Science Workshop Series</em> 
  being offered by KVL as part of our on-going efforts to build 
  capacity in core data science skills both at KAUST and within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). 
</p>
<p>
  The workshop curriculum largely follows the 
  <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">curriculum</a> developed by 
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>, a volunteer project dedicated to helping 
  researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research 
  computing skills.
</p>
<p>
  This is a live-coding based workshop and learners are expected to work along with the instructor using freely 
  available cloud resources provided by the <a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Binder</a> project.
